# 📖 Medical System

## 📌 Overview
The Medical System is a Python-based application designed to manage hospital workers and patients efficiently. It allows for tracking worker availability, patient visits, and streamlining facility operations.

## 📜 About
This project highlights fundamental Python programming concepts, including:
- **Functions and modular programming**: Each operation (adding workers, checking availability, viewing records) is implemented as a function.
- **Data structures**: Uses dictionaries to store worker and patient information efficiently.
- **User input handling**: Implements input validation and error handling to ensure smooth interactions.
- **Control flow**: Utilizes loops and conditional statements for menu-driven navigation.

## ✨ Features
- 🏥 **Add workers** with assigned rooms and ID numbers.
- ✅ **Check worker availability** and update their status.
- 📜 **View all registered workers** along with their details.
- ⏳ **Clock out workers** when they finish their shift.
- 🏥 **Add patients** with their reason for visit.
- 📋 **View all registered patients**.
- 💾 **Persistent tracking** of medical facility operations.

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/medical-system.git
   cd medical-system
   ```
2. **Run the script**:
   ```bash
